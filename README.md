## Story

You are the last knight of the Sky Kingdom.  
During a mysterious fall, you are cast down from your homeland and crash into the valley below.  
Stripped of your abilities, weakened, and unsure of what caused the fall, you begin your journey upward.

Your goal:  
Climb back to the Valley Kingdom, reclaim your lost abilities, and uncover the truth behind your fall.

Every step is a challenge.  
Every jump is a test.  
Every failure is a lesson.
